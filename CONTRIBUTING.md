## Project Styles

I personally do not like something that requires so many configurations before you can finally start the app.

- Settings should be configurable in the frontend. Environment variables are discouraged, unless it is related to startup such as `Malik Force_STACKS_DIR`
- Easy to use
- The web UI styling should be consistent and nice
- No native build dependency

## Coding Styles

- 4 spaces indentation
- Follow `.editorconfig`
- Follow ESLint
- Methods and functions should be documented with JSDoc

## Name Conventions

- Javascript/Typescript: camelCaseType
- SQLite: snake_case (Underscore)
- CSS/SCSS: kebab-case (Dash)

## Tools

- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/) >= 20
- [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)
- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/)
- IDE that supports [`ESLint`](https://eslint.org/) and EditorConfig (I am using [`IntelliJ IDEA`](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/))
- A SQLite GUI tool (f.ex. [`SQLite Expert Personal`](https://www.sqliteexpert.com/download.html) or [`DBeaver Community`](https://dbeaver.io/download/))

## Install Dependencies for Development

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Dev Server

```
pnpm run dev:frontend
pnpm run dev:backend
```

## Backend Dev Server

It binds to `0.0.0.0:5001` by default.

It is mainly a socket.io app + express.js.

## Frontend Dev Server

It binds to `0.0.0.0:5000` by default. The frontend dev server is used for development only.

For production, it is not used. It will be compiled to `frontend-dist` directory instead.

You can use Vue.js devtools Chrome extension for debugging.

### Build the frontend

```bash
pnpm run build
```

## Database Migration

TODO

## Dependencies

Both frontend and backend share the same package.json. However, the frontend dependencies are eventually not used in the production environment, because it is usually also baked into dist files. So:

- Frontend dependencies = "devDependencies"
    - Examples: vue, chart.js
- Backend dependencies = "dependencies"
    - Examples: socket.io, sqlite3
- Development dependencies = "devDependencies"
    - Examples: eslint, sass

### Update Dependencies

Should only be done by the maintainer.

```bash
pnpm update
````

It should update the patch release version only.

Patch release = the third digit ([Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/))

If for security / bug / other reasons, a library must be updated, breaking changes need to be checked by the person proposing the change.

## Translations

Please add **all** the strings which are translatable to `src/lang/en.json` (If translation keys are omitted, they can not be translated).

**Don't include any other languages in your initial Pull-Request** (even if this is your mother tongue), to avoid merge-conflicts between weblate and `master`.  
The translations can then (after merging a PR into `master`) be translated by awesome people donating their language skills.
